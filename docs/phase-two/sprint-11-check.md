# Sprint 11 check: website companion, sync and import

What Brad checks before the Sprint 11 gate. About 30 minutes, with a second computer for step 3 if you have one.

The backend needs jumetra-backend #7 (project sync) deployed for steps 3 and 4. Until then they work against a local backend only: Juma's pipeline deploys it, and Masden reviews the tables. Step 1's download needs no backend: it reads the GitHub release until the pipeline publishes to the backend.

## 1. The website sends people to the app

1. Open the home page and scroll to the end, **Then take it to your desk** (or follow **Desktop app** in the footer; the hybrid section's button is the same download).
   - On your Windows PC the big button says **Download for Windows**. Press it: the button turns into **Downloading 12%**, a notice in the corner shows how far it is (MB of MB, with Cancel), and when the file is in your downloads the notice says **Downloaded! Kiungo for Windows is ready to install**, that it matches the release's checksum, and what to do next. **All downloads** lists every installer with its size; each downloads the same way.
   - Turn Wi-Fi off part-way: the notice says where the connection dropped, and **Try again** carries on from there once you're back. (Every other problem has its own words too: a file that's gone, too many downloads at once, the download server down, a damaged file, a browser that couldn't hold it.)
   - On a phone there's no button: it says the app runs on computers, and the list is still there.
   - The four tabs (**Code and run**, **Real board**, **Robot world**, **Fix mistakes**) swap the screenshot and its caption; the arrow keys work on them too.
   - **How to open the beta** says what to do about the Windows and macOS warnings (the installers aren't signed yet).
2. Install it from that download. Windows warns (SmartScreen: More info, Run anyway); the app opens to the sign-in screen.
3. **Hybrid Hardware** shows three modes (Virtual, Physical, Hybrid). The Simulator mode is gone, from the docs too.
4. **Firmware** shows a Preview note at the top: building and uploading moved to the desktop app.
5. The website's lab has a **Desktop app** link in its toolbar (on wide screens).
6. Lighthouse on the home page, mobile: performance ______, LCP ______ s. Pass: 90 or more, and 2.5 s or less.

Where the download comes from: the backend's `/releases/latest` when the release pipeline has published there (Juma's token); otherwise the GitHub release of the desktop version the site was built with, read from its `kiungo-release.json` on GitHub's download CDN; otherwise the newest GitHub release from the API (rate-limited for a shared host like Vercel, so it's last; `GITHUB_TOKEN` in the site's environment lifts the limit). The first beta, `desktop-v0.11.0`, was published on 2026-11-03 from `main` by that workflow (six installers and the checksum manifest). Until a release exists, the section says the first beta is being prepared.

**To publish the next one**: bump `apps/desktop/package.json`, then either push the tag (`git tag desktop-v<version> && git push origin desktop-v<version>`) or open **Actions → Release the desktop app → Run workflow** on `main` with the channel set to beta. The workflow builds the installers on Windows, Ubuntu and macOS (about five minutes), refuses a version that already has a release, and the home page picks the new one up within five minutes.

How the download works: GitHub's release downloads carry no CORS headers, so a plain link hands the file to the browser and the page can't tell how it went. The page therefore fetches the file through its own `/api/desktop/download`, which streams the release asset (only this project's release URLs are allowed) in 8 MB ranges, so that it can show progress, carry on after a dropped connection, and check the file against the manifest's SHA-512 before saving it. The bytes pass through Vercel, which counts them as data transfer (about 150 MB per download); `KIUNGO_DOWNLOAD_MODE=browser` in the site's environment switches the buttons back to plain links if that ever matters. If the route itself is down, the page falls back to the plain link on its own and says so.

## 2. Phase One work comes across (DSK-15)

1. On the website, save a lab session (in the lab, signed in) and make a project on the Projects page.
2. In the desktop app, signed in as the same person, go to Home > **Import** > **From the Kiungo website…**. Both are listed.
3. Import the lab session. It opens as a project with the same parts and wires, a blank sketch for its board, and a note if the board can't be built for here (a Pico, say).
4. Import the website project. It opens as a blank project, with its description, objectives, hardware and team in `records/about.md`.
5. Import the same lab session again. It says it's a second copy.
6. Also try **Import > A lab session file…** with a `.kiungo.json` exported from the website's lab.

## 3. Sync (DSK-14)

1. Home > **On your account**: tick **Keep a copy of my projects on my account**. Off is the default: nothing leaves the computer until you turn it on.
2. Open a project. The chip by **Saved** says **Synced** (hover it for the revision). Change the code, wait about 30 seconds, or close the project: it syncs.
3. On a second computer (or a second user profile), sign in and turn sync on. The project is listed under **On your account**. **Bring to this computer** opens it.
4. Change the sketch on both computers without syncing in between, then open it on the first. Your version stays. The other is saved beside it as `sketch.ino (from OTHER-PC 2 Nov).txt`, and the chip says **Synced, with a conflict**.
5. Work offline: the chip says **Offline**, and everything else works as usual.

## Gate question

Does the website send people to the app without losing anyone?

## Known limits

- Sync is per project and whole files, not live collaboration. While a project is open, changes made on another computer are taken the next time it opens (the chip says so).
- Projects sync up to 20 MB, each file up to 2 MB, with 200 MB per account (the backend's limits, for Masden to confirm).
- The web firmware tools still work for now. Retiring the server build endpoints is a backend change, left for after launch.
