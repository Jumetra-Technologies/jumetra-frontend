/**
 * A Hybrid run (RUN-01, RUN-04, INJ-01 to INJ-06): the user's sketch on the
 * real board, with Kiungo playing the virtual parts.
 *
 *  1. The Ship build: the sketch as it is, which is what the board would run
 *     without Kiungo. It judges whether the program fits (HWT-03).
 *  2. The Hybrid build: a copy of the sketch with the runtime and the shim,
 *     for the board chosen. Its extra flash and RAM are the Hybrid layer's
 *     cost, shown apart (HWT-02, HWT-04).
 *  3. Upload it, then talk to the board over the link: push the virtual
 *     parts' values, read the sketch's Serial text and what it drove (OUT-01).
 *
 * The copy keeps the sketch's own files byte for byte after two added lines
 * at the top of each (the marker and the shim) and a #line that puts the
 * compiler's line numbers back where they belong.
